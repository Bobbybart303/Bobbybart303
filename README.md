- Hello there I am Debobby also known as Bobbybart303, Friknob9500, or bobby and Devbobby. I am a roblox game developer who came from the Unity Platform developing in C# and C++ and went to roblox studio to learn lua and now here I am as a developer!
I am always wanting to have fun and help, I do not really like to script I rather do building more then anything but I will do it if I have to.
This is my FIRST ever thing I have completed for a game called Project Unnkvown!
